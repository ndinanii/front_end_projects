            <h2>A Brief Overview of His Life and Work</h2>
            <p>
                Frantz Omar Fanon (July 20, 1925 – December 6, 1961) was a Martinican-born psychiatrist, philosopher,
                revolutionary, and writer whose works are influential in the fields of post-colonial studies,
                critical theory, and Marxism. As an intellectual, Fanon was a political radical, Pan-Africanist,
                and Marxist humanist concerned with the psychopathology of colonization and the human, social,
                and cultural consequences of decolonization.
            </p>
            <p>
                His most famous works include <em>Black Skin, White Masks</em> (1952) and <em>The Wretched of the Earth</em> (1961).
                These texts explore the psychological effects of colonialism on both the colonizer and the colonized,
                advocating for the necessity of decolonization, sometimes through violent struggle.
